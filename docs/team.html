<h2>Join us</h2>

<p>We are always inviting research engineers (i.e. researchers, engineers, and those in-between :) with deep knowledge and affection for their craft.</p>

<p>The main qualifications are a desire to solve complex knowledge-related problems, primarily using Lisp, and experience of doing just that or related things.</p>

<p>Our preference of Lisp doesn't mean that we don't utilize other programming languages in our work, but Lisp will always remain a first-class citizen, which means that you should be able to understand it, work with it at least in a limited capacity (and be interested in learning more), and not just tolerate, but appreciate such situation.</p>

<p>Our central location is Kyiv, Ukraine, but we don't have any restrictions or preferences regarding your location and are ready to work with people across the globe.</p>

<p>Our projects keep coming, but so far, there are no specific roles we want to hire for. Rather, it's an opportunity to join more as a partner that an employee.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you should write to <a href="m&#x61;&#105;l&#x74;&#111;:&#x76;&#115;@&#x6D;&#56;n&#x77;&#97;r&#x65;&#46;c&#x6F;&#109;">m&#x61;&#105;l&#x74;&#111;:&#x76;&#115;@&#x6D;&#56;n&#x77;&#97;r&#x65;&#46;c&#x6F;&#109;</a>.</p>

<h2>Our values</h2>

<p>These principles constitute the basis of our future mutual understanding and productive cooperation, so you've got to share them to be happy working with us. Also, we're not willing to compromise them even for the sake of higher profits, faster growth, better market position or achieving other popular measures of company success. The ultimate success of this company will be in making its employees and customers happy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technological excellence</strong>, i.e. putting the technical qualities of our work above non-technical considerations. An example of applying this value is our adherence to Lisp as a default choice for most of our solutions despite the fact that the language socially is quite unpopular and underappreciated. Another example is that, in our company, literally everyone should be technology-savvy.</li>
<li><strong>Personalism</strong> is the defining trait of the company's interaction with all the people around it: employees, customers, contractors, and providers. This means, for example, striving to provide flexible and productive working conditions to each employee instead of trying to fit everyone in the same conditions. Another manifestation of this is that (m8n)ware is conceived as a distributed organization from day one.</li>
<li><strong>Ahimsa</strong> is an ancient word meaning not harming anyone. It is a little bit more than our modern-day ethics. Why create something if you know that it will cause misery and suffering to others? In effect, this means, for example, refusal to provide services to companies that are clearly unethical.</li>
<li><strong>Radical openness</strong>. As they say, &quot;information wants to be free.&quot; Maximal sharing and minimal secrecy make so many things much simpler. And in our lowest-common-denominator technology world, ultimately, the risk of competitors copying and abusing your work is much less than that of brilliant people not joining your cause because they just haven't heard of it. Surely, this doesn't mean that we will breach legal agreements or laws, but we'll default to open vs closed whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>More justification and discussion of these values may be found in a blog post &quot;<a href="http://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-technology-company-case.html" >The Technology Company Case.</a>&quot;</p>
